# go.sh

## Installation instructions

Personally, I recommend creating a '/bin' folder in the $HOME directory and then creating a directory for this specific script inside of that 'bin' folder.
I use 
>>> alias go="source ~$HOME/bin/go/go.sh" 
in order to simply be able to type
>>> go <parameters>
to use the script but you can also modify your $PATH variable if you want to, which would make sense, especially if you're going for the 'bin' folder.
